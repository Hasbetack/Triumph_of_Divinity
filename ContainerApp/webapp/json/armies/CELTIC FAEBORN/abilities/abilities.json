    "Master of Magic": "Instead of generating a Magic Pool in the Magic Step this Formation generates its own Magic Pool in the Magic Step that only it can draw dice from. This Formationâ€™s Magic Pool contains X+5 dice where X is the casting level of the Formation. In addition, if this Formation does not have to LEGENDARY Tag then when casting the Magic Blast Magic Spell, that spell deals 1 Ethereal Damage instead of D3."
