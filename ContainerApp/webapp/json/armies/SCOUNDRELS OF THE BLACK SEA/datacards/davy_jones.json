Place a marker at the current location of the selected Formation and then remove the Formation you sent to the locker from the battlefield. Then at the start of each following step your opponent must roll a D6. On a result of 5+ the Formation in the locker returns from the locker at the end of the current step and must be setup wholly within 3\" of the marker placed when they were sent to the locker. While a Formation is in the locker it is considered to have been slain for all rules purposes but selecting a Formation to be place in the locker does not count as destroying it.
