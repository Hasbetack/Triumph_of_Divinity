While a Formation is embarked upon this model it may attack with any ranged weapons as if it were on the battlefield and it measures ranges and line of sight from this model. If an embarked Formation chooses to disembark from this model, then at the end of any movement step you may set up the disembarking Formation wholly within 6\" of this model and more than 9\" from enemy Formations. If this model is destroyed, then all embarked Formations must disembark as if it were the end of the movement step."
